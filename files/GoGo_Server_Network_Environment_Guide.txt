GoGo Server Network Environment Configuration Guide

Introduction to GoGo Server

A GoGo server is a specialized configuration used in network environments for managing communication between a server and a group of clients. It is specifically designed to implement the so called GoGo protocol, facilitating interactions between the server and connected clients.

Configuring Network Settings
For setting up network parameters like IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways, standard CISCO commands are utilized.

Key Component: GoGo Server Pool
The essential element of a GoGo server is its GoGo Server Pool, which acts as a central hub containing the server, its properties, and the managed clients.

Managing the GoGo Server Pool
Creation: To create a new GoGo server pool, use the command: create GoGo_server_pool <GoGo_SERVER_POOL_NAME>
Deletion: To delete an existing GoGo server pool, use: delete GoGo_server_pool <GoGo_SERVER_POOL_NAME>
Access: To access a specific GoGo server pool, use: access GoGo_server_pool <GoGo_SERVER_POOL_NAME>

Note: Attempting to access a non-existent pool will result in an exception. The 'create' command also grants access if the pool already exists.

Adding the GoGo Server to the Pool
After defining or accessing the GoGo server pool, add the server's IP address using: add GoGo_server <SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>
This command initiates a network search (FK_SEND) for the server; if found, an acknowledgement (FK_ACK) is received, allowing further configuration.

Configuring GoGo Server Pool Settings
Number of GoGo Clients: Set the maximum number of connectable GoGo clients using: num_GoGos <DEFINE_NUM_OF_GoGoS>
Mirror Configuration: Include a GoGo mirror in the server for replicating behavior, configurable with: mirror <IP_ADDRESS_MIRROR>
Adding GoGo Clients: Introduce GoGo clients to the server's pool with: add GoGo_client <CLIENT_IP_ADDRESS>
Similar to the server, a network search (FKCL_SEND) locates the client; a successful find results in
an acknowledgement (FKCL_ACK) for continued configuration.

Example Configuration
For a GoGo server pool named MY_POOL with a maximum of 10 clients, the GoGo server IP address 192.168.1.1 /24, the mirror IP address 192.168.1.2 /24, and clients from 192.168.1.10 /24 to 192.168.1.15 /24, the configuration commands would be:

create GoGo_server_pool MY_POOL
add GoGo_server 192.168.1.1 /24
mirror 192.168.1.2 /24
num_GoGos 10
add GoGo_client 192.168.1.110 /24
add GoGo_client 192.168.1.111 /24
add GoGo_client 192.168.1.112 /24
add GoGo_client 192.168.1.113 /24
add GoGo_client 192.168.1.114 /24
add GoGo_client 192.168.1.115 /24
